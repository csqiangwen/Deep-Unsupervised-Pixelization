## ![Our teaser](./teaser/teaser.png)
## Requirement
- Python 3.5
- PIL
- Numpy
- Pytorch 0.4.0
- Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
## Dataset
### Training Dataset
Create the folders `trainA` and `trainB` in the directory `./samples/`. Note that `trainA` and `trainB` contain the clip arts to be pixelized and pixel arts to be depixelized respectively.
### Testing Dataset
Create the folders `testA` and `testB` in the directory `./samples/`. Note that `testA` and `testB` contain the clip arts to be pixelized and pixel arts to be depixelized respectively.
## Training
* To train a model:
``` bash
python3 ./train.py --dataroot ./samples --resize_or_crop crop --gpu_ids 0
```  
or you can directly:
``` bash 
$ bash ./train.sh
```  
You can check the losses of models in the file `./checkpoints_pixelization/loss_log.txt`.  
More training flags in the files `./options/base_options.py` and `./options/train_options.py`.
## Testing
* After training, all models have been saved in the directory `./checkpoints_pixelization/`.
* To test a model:
``` bash
python3 ./test.py --dataroot ./samples --no_dropout --resize_or_crop crop --gpu_ids 0 --how_many 1 --which_epoch 200
```  
or you can directly:
``` bash 
$ bash ./test.sh
```  
More testing flags in the file `./options/base_options.py`.  
All testing results will be shown in the directory `./results_pixelization/`.
## Note
Since this proposed method has been used in commerce, we cannot release the pretrained model and training dataset.
